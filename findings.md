# Findings

**Purpose**: Research, discoveries, constraints, root causes. Updated by agents after each meaningful task. **Use for "never repeat"**: When an issue is fixed, add the root cause here so it does not recur. (Historical lessons: `apps/worker/legacy_archive/lessons.md`.)

- **Full video + regen workflow**: Generate FULL video first. Quality issues (cartoon, style drift) can appear in any scene (2, 3, 4+). To fix bad clips only: `JOB_ID=xxx CLIP_NUMBERS=2,3 npx tsx tools/regen-clips.ts`. MAX_CLIPS=1 is DEBUG ONLY—never for quality validation.
- **Smoke "stuck"**: Job can sit behind others in BullMQ queue. Run `npx tsx tools/smoke-preflight.ts --drain` first to clear waiting jobs + ensure credits. Worker must have MAX_CLIPS=1 for fast (1-clip) smoke.
- **Video quality (cartoon, style drift, weird motion)**: Kling was getting no negative prompt. Added short `KLING_REALTOR_NEGATIVE` (~250 chars): cartoon, duplicate person, walking in circles, barefoot, different century, etc. Updated `buildRealtorOnlyKlingPrompt`: "Person moves FORWARD through the space—no circular pacing", "Photorealistic. Preserve the exact room, furniture, and style shown in the image."
- **Kie.ai Kling 422 (multi_shots)**: Kie returned 422 "multi_shots cannot be empty" when we omitted the field. Fix: add `multi_shots: false` to Kling input.
- **Kie.ai Kling 500 (our fault)**: We passed Zillow/source URLs to Kie when ensurePublicUrl failed. Kie cannot fetch those (blocked, auth-required) → 500. Fix: (1) ensurePublicUrl returns null on fetch/upload failure, never original URL. (2) Never pad additionalPublic with original photos. (3) config.r2.publicUrl fallback to r2.dev when unset. (4) kie.ts: isPublicFetchableUrl guard—reject Zillow/non-http URLs before API call. (5) Throw UnrecoverableError when zero usable photos.
- **Agent "stuck" / silent wait**: User had to ask "are you stuck?" because agent ran long commands without progress. Never run one command >3 min without intermediate output. Rule: bounded iterations, report between chunks, explicit timeouts. Never say "I'm stuck"—hit timeout, report, try next approach. See agent-behavior.mdc.
- **Pipeline config duplication**: Clip duration (5s) and max clips (15) were hardcoded in kie.ts, prompt-generator, video-pipeline. Fix: TOURREEL_REALTOR_HANDOFF_SPEC §0b declares config.ts as SSOT; all code reads config.video.defaultClipDuration and config.video.maxClipsPerVideo.
- **Port confusion**: README said site 3001 (wrong—it's 3002). VIDEO_APP_USER_GUIDE said localhost:3000 (wrong—3002). e2e-from-zillow, run-smoke defaulted to 3002 for API_URL but worker is 3001 when both run. Fix: PORT_REFERENCE.md = SSOT. All docs/tools updated.
- **Conflict audit protocol**: When user asks "do you have conflicts?"—run CONFLICT_AUDIT_2026-02-15.md checks (git, ports, docs, config), do not confirm without executing. Audit doc is runnable checklist.
- **Kie.ai charges every couple minutes**: BullMQ retries (attempts: 3, backoff 30s) caused repeated pipeline runs when job failed (e.g. Insufficient Credits). Each retry = full Kie.ai usage. Fix: throw `UnrecoverableError` for unrecoverable errors.

- **Local docs → NotebookLM**: Two-round migration. Round 1: core docs. Round 2 (gap audit): full REFERENCE_ALIGNMENT (hierarchy, sync), full design system (backgrounds, Tailwind, layout patterns), full pipeline (testing, config, model compliance, three fixes), AGENT_SELF_AUDIT, AGENT_HANDOFF, 3-SCENE_VERIFICATION, full gemini (Lead/Token schema). AGENT_SELF_AUDIT, AGENT_HANDOFF, 3-SCENE_VERIFICATION still in codebase; content duplicated in 0baf5f36.

- **Documentation discipline**: Agent created progress.md, findings.md, REFERENCE_ALIGNMENT, work-method rules—then failed to use them. Did not log job creation, browser verification, or session events. User: "I see you disrespect me and ignore what we do here." Rule: Update progress.md and findings.md after each task, not only at session end. "Each little thing" = log it.

- **Real-data video page flow**: When worker running + VIDEO_WORKER_URL set + valid job ID: page shows real address (1531 Home Park Dr), real listing, status from DB. Job `68fc0ba2-4415-4841-a7a9-b47288b38b43` showed FAILED (credits). Mock only when worker 404/unreachable in dev.

- **Reference alignment**: Agent was mixing references (Cursor rules vs CLAUDE vs brain vs NotebookLM vs Antigravity vs Aitable vs Postgres) because no canonical hierarchy existed. Created REFERENCE_ALIGNMENT.md: precedence order, topic→SSOT map, sync discipline, anti-patterns. Ensures B.L.A.S.T. and other methods are taken seriously via explicit hierarchy.

- **Work method accountability**: User repeatedly finds issues before agent. Root causes: no browser verification before handoff; reactive fixes; ignoring feedback. Created work-method-accountability.mdc (alwaysApply) with mandatory: open URL in browser for user-facing flows; run dry-run for pipeline changes; acknowledge work-method failure when user reports.

- **Pipeline Veo violation**: video-pipeline.worker.ts had Veo as fallback despite TOURREEL_REALTOR_HANDOFF_SPEC and AGENT_SELF_AUDIT saying "Kling 3 only". Removed. Model rules now in TOURREEL_REALTOR_HANDOFF_SPEC §0.

- **VideoGeneration error handling**: When `/api/video/jobs/[id]` returns 4xx/5xx, the frontend threw "Failed to fetch job". Causes: (1) visiting `/video/mock-job-001` while VIDEO_WORKER_URL is set → worker 404; (2) job ID typo → 404; (3) worker down → 502. Fixes: (a) Parse error body, surface `data.error` or `Failed to fetch job (status)`. (b) **Dev fallback**: API route returns mock job when worker 404/5xx or unreachable (IS_DEV). In dev, any `/video/[id]` loads—no error. Production stays strict.

- **Process gap**: User found "Failed to fetch job" before agent. Rules require "Test in browser" but agent did not open the video URL before handoff. Added explicit rule in work-method-accountability.mdc: "User-facing flows: Open the URL in the browser and confirm it loads without console errors before sharing with the user."

- **Agent reporting**: User does not want session updates in conversation. Update progress.md and findings.md at end of every task. The project memory files are the reference—not the user. If out of context or missing access, state what is needed.

- **Video test prep**: Before next video test—(1) Deploy worker to RackNerd if testing there. (2) Preflight --free passes. (3) Create job or retry-fresh. (4) progress.md has "Last Video Issues" and "Before Next Video Test" checklist.
